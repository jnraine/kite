	<h4>Where can I find the details for a listing?</h4>
	<p>Easy! Just tap the event title and it'll open up to display all of them. Tap the same title again or another event's title to close the details.</p>

	<h4>Why isn't there anything listed in a category?</h4>
	<p>When a category is empty that just means the events are all over and there's nothing coming up within the week.</p>
